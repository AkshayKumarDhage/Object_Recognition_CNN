# Near State-of-the-Art results at Object Recognition

This project uses Convolutional neural network(CNN) for object recognition.

This CNN obtained state-of-the-art performance at object recognition on the CIFAR-10 image dataset.

This project has model built using Keras, NN API that with Tensorflow as backend;

The dataset use is CIFAE-10 dataset, consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class.
There are 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.
